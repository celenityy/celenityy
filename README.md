<h4>
    
Hi there, thanks for stopping by. 👋 I'm just your average person on the internet™.

It should be noted that this is a mirror of my page from [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Magnesium1062), which I primarily use & prefer to use where possible instead of GitHub, due to privacy concerns and a distrust of Microsoft.

If you ever need to contact me, please feel free to email me at `retmaghub@proton.me`, and I'll do my best to reply. My PGP public key can be found [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=retmaghub@proton.me).

I maintain [BadBlock](https://github.com/Retold3202/BadBlock), a suite of filters to enhance your content blocker of choice. I also contribute to various other projects, such as [HaGeZi's DNS Blocklists](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists).

I also write various guides/outlines of my personal settings & recommendations for different apps, services, extensions, and other software to optimize and make the most out of them.

I currently have guides for:
